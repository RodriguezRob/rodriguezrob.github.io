        A Brief Journey
      </h2>
      <p>
        
          I am an aspiring Web Developer with an unconventional path into the technology field. While my Bachelor's degree in English Literature and Language from California State Polytechnic University, Pomona, initially led me towards a career in teaching, the pandemic disrupted my plans during my postgraduate studies for teaching credentials, leading me to reconsider my career path. It was during this time that I rediscovered my passion for web development, a field I had previously explored through personal projects like customizing Myspace layouts and building occasional websites.
            <br>
            <br>
          Being self-taught, I eagerly sought out every available resource to deepen my knowledge and skills in web development. The ever-evolving landscape of technology excites me, and I have devoted myself to continuous learning to keep up with industry trends and best practices.
            <br>
            <br>
          Driven by my passion for creativity and problem-solving, I now seek to pivot my career into technology as a full-time Web Developer. I am determined to leverage my self-taught expertise and past experiences to contribute effectively to the world of web development. Embracing this career change, I am excited about the opportunities to grow, collaborate, and make meaningful contributions in the dynamic and innovative technology industry.
