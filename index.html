        A Brief Journey
      </h2>
      <p>
        I am an unconventional Web Developer. Like many in this space, I am self taught, and have utilized every resource I can find to explore this passion. Originally earning a Bachelor's degree in English Literature and Language from California State Polytechnic University, Pomona, I endeavored to become an English teacher. When the pandemic hit I was in the middle of my post graduate studies for my teaching credentials and reluctantly, I had to withdraw. Since then, I revisited a former passion of mine, web development. Like many before me, I was very lightly introduced to styling and web development through Myspace. Since then, I have occasionally built websites, and now look to pursue my passion as a full time opportunity.

        Goals & Background
      </h2>
      <p>
      My aim is to begin my journey as a Web Developer, and transition into a full stack developer. Ultimately I aim to help companies through ther entire lifecycle of a project and hope to design projects with a simultaneous focus on user experience and functionality. My creative background has been a great asset in the design space. I have been featured in multiple art shows, currently have a mural on display in Atlanta and have designed elements for several local brands.
